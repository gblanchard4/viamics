  "Visual and statistical analysis framework for microbial communities, and more".

===============================================================================
 Framework
===============================================================================

 This codebase contains the pre-alpha version of a statistical analysis and
visualization framework that has been developed mainly for microbial community
and microbial ecology studies.

 Publication of this study, titled "A framework for analysis of metagenomic
sequencing data", is here:

    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21121041

 Also a static snapshot of the framework, along with some basic information
about it's purpose, could be found here:

===============================================================================
 Installation
===============================================================================

 Installation from source might be a little bit tricky for novice users.

 Beta release of the Framework will provide a better installation. This part,
though, is for programmers and command line enthusiasts who like to get
framework running.

 I tried to maintain following recipe, but this may not be the complete list of
commands in order to get framework running. If you have been trying to install
Viamics and if you need any help please don't hesitate to send an e-mail to:

    a.murat.eren / gmail.com

 Sorry for this temporary mess and inconvenience.

# The framework was developed and tested on Pardus Corporate (64 bit) version.
# It should work on any Linux distribution and even Mac, but most of the
# commands in the following section will work only on Pardus Corporate. You
# may evaluate the commands and use appropriate packages for your distro,
# but if you would like to go with Pardus Corporate, you can download it
# here:
#
#   ftp://ftp.pardus.org.tr/pub/ISO/Kurulan/Corporate2/Alpha/x86_64/
#
cat /etc/pardus-release
Pardus Corporate 2 Alpha

# at this point I assume you have the codebase and you are in the root
# directory of the Framework

===============================================================================
 Running
===============================================================================

 1. Running the server: run "python server.py" command in "framework"
 directory.

 2. Running web client: run "python manage.py runserver" command in
 "framework/clients/ferrisweb/" directory, it will run a lightweighted web
 server you can use to connect to the framework. You will see the address in
 the output (or instead you can setup your Apache installation and use .htaccess
 file to relay web requests to the framework codebase).
